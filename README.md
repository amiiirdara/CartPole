## CartPole

This project appears to be performing reinforcement learning using the Gym library in Python.

**It specifically**
**Phase1**: Focuses on the **"CartPole"** environment provided by Gym.
**Phase2**: Takes a look to some algorithms like QLearning and SARSA.
**Phase3**: Provides a custom env named CustomMiniGridEnv instead of using Gym environments and apply Tabular QLearning on it.
**Phase4**: Makes itself better and better in deeper insights
